			Day 1: June 26, 2017
		</h2>
		<p class="entry-text">
			Today I jumped into a vegan lifestyle with both feet and enthusiasm. My oldest son thinks I'm crazy and my mother is worried I won't get enough protein, but I am confident in my decision and proud of myself. What is key is that I have a strong sense of purpose behind this. I watched three life-changing documentaries in the last four weeks: "What's With Wheat", "What the Health", and "Cowspiracy" (all on Netflix right now). <br><br>
			These documentaries have exposed just how destructive the food industry is not only on our health, but also on the environment. As a lover of nature and National Park vacationer, I feel compelled to do my part. I love animals and I cannot allow my desires to consume meat, eggs, and dairy be the reason for their ongoing suffering.<br><br>
			Another compelling reason is my health. I already have one autoimmune disease and I am not getting any younger. On top of that, there is a history of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer in my family. They say a best defense is a strong offense, so that's what I'm doing. Before my health deteriorates, I'm making healthy decisions that will improve my quality of life. I am excited for this journey and what I will learn about myself.

			Day 2: June 27, 2017
		</h2>
		<p class="entry-text">
			Today brought some headaches, but that was to be expected. I had plans to do some yoga with a good friend, however we switched that up and took her 22 month old adorable daughter for a fun walk around my neighborhood. That was much easier on my head than downward dog. I've been monitoring my macros and am happy to report that I have gotten about 50 grams of protein yesterday and today. I am also having an easier time choosing meals and monitoring my hunger. I feel like my body is less bloated already. However, the best part of this is my mouth changes! I used to struggle big time with teeth pain caused by meat stuck in my teeth. I was also always self concious of my breath... I had major halitosis paranoia! But in just two days, all of that has gone away! I could not be happier. I look forward to what each new day will bring.

			Day 3: June 28, 2017
		</h2>
		<p class="entry-text">
			Today was my anniversary, so I was thinking that I may be tempted to eat non-vegan, but no such urge was present. This is the most amazing thing... you see, I've struggled with an eating disorder my entire life. But this week has not been a battle. It's been a comfortable way of monitoring my hunger and eating nutrient dense food that leaves me feeling satisfied like never before. I am so grateful that this is my life now. My boyfriend and I celebrated four years together and it didn't require animal products at all. Usually we would go out to dinner and have steak or seafood. But tonight, we saved money by dining in. I threw together some tacos and we had some pear cider. We listened to good music and talk about some of our favorite memories we've made together. I don't know how I existed as a non-vegan for so long. I feel so much more complete and at peace in the short time I've been following this lifestyle.

			Day 4: June 29, 2017
		</h2>
		<p class="entry-text">
			Another successful day! My family is not following a vegan plan yet, so I'm still preparing meat for them, however, I'm not tasting anything. They've complained that the last three dinners were awful. I felt bad, but I'm committed to this thing and won't give in just so their food can taste better. I won't force this on them, but I hope to continue to inspire them. Tonight, I slow roasted a turkey breast for them and they seemed happy this time. I guess I didn't mess that one up. <br><br>
			Tomorrow we head out for a camping trip. I'll admit I'm a little nervous about what I'll eat, but I think I'll be able to do just fine. We're bringing our rice cooker and an electric burner, so I'm pretty sure I can create some good dishes without issue. If all else fails, canned beans are a great option!<br><br>
			I felt more energetic today. My focus is improving, and my mood seems to be more stable. I like noticing these small changes and look forward to documenting more.
